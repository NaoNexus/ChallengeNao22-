							The exhibition "My Hell: Dante, Prophet of Hope" took place from March 29 to May 29, 2022, in the Bastione delle Maddalene and was a unique event dedicated to the Supreme Poet, who found refuge in our beloved city during his exile. It was a multi-sensory journey with images, videos, and sounds, narrated by three-year high school students (accompanied by guides and tutors from the Rivela Association). The special guest was NAO, a humanoid robot which, thanks to the NaoNexus team, became a comparable guide for the students present at the exhibition. The event made use of the fundamental contributions of Professor Franco Nembrini (essayist and pedagogue) and Gabriele Dell'Otto (cartoonist and illustrator) whose collaboration made it possible to tell Dante's Inferno of the essayist through the artist's illustrations.

							The exhibition covered an area of 500 square meters, winding through the tunnels and passageways of the Bastione delle Maddalene. The itinerary was divided into 35 stages, marked by illustrations accompanied by insights and reflections. An integral part of the event was the work "El Dante", created by the sculptor Adelfo Galli. Nao assisted the visitors by interacting with them through an application created by the team, which allowed the robot to guide them and present them with the 8 exhibited works based on the requests received. Nao was able to show visitors the selected works thanks to the "Nao Markers", tags placed under each work. Thanks to the visual recognition sensors and the camera positioned on the robot's head, it was able to recognize the symbol present on each of the Nao Markers and consequently direct itself towards the chosen work. Once its task was finished, it returned to the starting point where it waited for new requests.

							Nao participated in the press conference organized by the Municipality, presenting the project to a high-profile audience. The regional councilor for culture, Professor Nembrini, principal Umberto Fasol, and some members of the Rivela Association were the first to learn about this exciting project and all its nuances. Furthermore, the robot also made an appearance on the wings of the Camploy theater, presenting the NaoNexus Team and what it had to offer to the public.
