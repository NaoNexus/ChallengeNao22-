						<p>This year our project for Nao challenge 2023 will be focused on the main theme of sustainability. It will be supported by Amperia, important company in the ecoliving field working all around Italy to make structures more efficient through home technology systems. Thanks to their knowledge and experience in this field NaoNexus will be able to enter in a completely new sector.</p>
						<p>This year the main project of the team that will be taken to the Nao challenge is centered on the development of a system to recognize a right living state inside schools, structures and places all around the country.</p>

						<p>The humanoid robot will be able to obtain thanks to its sensors rates of CO2, temperature, humidity  and light in different structures and rooms; and directly act to improve the situation registered. the robot will in fact be able to change the disposition of windows and lights in a room through its robotic.Thanks to a second sensor provided by Amperia, it will also be able also to determine the exact amount of trees that needs to be planted in order to lower higher rates of CO2 in polluted areas.</p>
						<p>It’s considerate to say that the task will completely revolve around the humanoid robot Nao that will behave to achieve all these goals. The team will focus on programming the humanoid robot and develop the robotics around it. During these months working around it the team had the possibility to evolve their creativity, capabilities an knowledge around the field.</p>
						<p>All these information will be given in the form of a dialogue between a volunteer, and so a real person, and a robot Nao that will take the role of a Ambiental consultant. It will be able to answer all the volunteer’s questions and give suggestions about possible actions that could be done to improve its situations. An example could be the number of solar panels to lower light consume or trees that could be planted to lower CO2 rates.</p>
						<p>This all project has the purpouse to make the living spaces all around our country better in every kind of way. More efficient, evironmental friendly and sustainable. All this will be made thanks to the humanoid robot Nao and the informatic and rotic system created around it.</p>
