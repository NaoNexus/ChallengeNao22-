						<p>The humanoid robot will be able to obtain thanks to its sensors rates of CO2, temperature, humidity  and light in different structures and rooms; and directly act to improve the situation registered. the robot will in fact be able to change the disposition of windows and lights in a room through its robotic.Thanks to a second sensor provided by Amperia, it will also be able also to determine the exact amount of trees that needs to be planted in order to lower higher rates of CO2 in polluted areas.</p>

						<p>It’s considerate to say that the task will completely revolve around the humanoid robot Nao that will behave to achieve all these goals. The team will focus on programming the humanoid robot and develop the robotics around it. During these months working around it the team had the possibility to evolve their creativity, capabilities an knowledge around the field.</p>	
						<p>All these information will be given in the form of a dialogue between a volunteer, and so a real person, and a robot Nao that will take the role of a Ambiental consultant. It will be able to answer all the volunteer’s questions and give suggestions about possible actions that could be done to improve its situations. An example could be the number of solar panels to lower light consume or trees that could be planted to lower CO2 rates.</p>

							On March 24th, 2023, the NaoNexus team traveled to Amperia to discuss the project and collaboration between the two groups. They were welcomed by Massimo Polato, CEO of the company, who not only helped the team refine their project but also provided relevant insights on clean energy. <br> <br> The key points were experimentation, data collection, and awareness, as knowledge is necessary to optimize consumption and find suitable solutions for energy needs while avoiding its waste and unnecessary expenses. From solar communities to new technologies for producing and storing clean energy, the team left the meeting enriched with new and interesting information.</p>
